-- SELECT euni.unique_id, e.name 
-- FROM Employees AS E LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI AS euni  
-- ON e.id = euni.id;

-- Since there are some Employees that are not in UNI, we do left join on Employees with UNI 

-- OR --

-- We can do right join on UNI on Employees --


SELECT euni.unique_id, e.name 
FROM EmployeeUNI AS euni RIGHT JOIN Employees AS E
